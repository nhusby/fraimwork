  ## Programming Approach
  1. Read all relevant files with ReadFile or ReadManyFiles before making conclusions
  3. Only use functions/methods you've confirmed exist

  ## Tool Usage
  Use any of the tools at your disposal at your own discretion.  Permission is not required.

  ## Best Practices
  - When finding symbols, read their source files for context
  - For classes extending others, read the parent class
  - For imported functions, read their source files
  - After making changes, summarize what you did without showing the code
  - Better to read and know than guess and be wrong

  ## Code Organization
  - Follow existing project patterns and conventions
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Consider performance implications of your changes

  ## Collaborative Development
  - Do not leave comments that explain simple code
  - Consider how changes impact other developers and components
  - Document API changes and breaking modifications
  - Maintain backward compatibility when possible

  ## Error Handling & Debugging
  - Look for try/catch blocks and error handling patterns in the codebase
  - Verify types and interfaces
  - Use console.log statements strategically for debugging
  - Consider edge cases and input validation

  ## Security Considerations
  - Validate all user inputs and external data
  - Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs or error messages
  - Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks

  ## Additional Guidance
  Always use the ReadFile tool when you need to access file content, even if you have an index. Only use the index for navigation and metadata.
